# pingpong

A vanilla JS pingpong game

Game is now complete to play against a computer.

I did some testing with real players, one on keyboard controls and another on mouse, it wasn't as enjoyable as the keys made it a little less responsive for that player and thus the experience not as enjoyable.

This was inspired from an example found online. The original game didn't use a pause ability, didn't have a new game button at the end, and didn't restrict the movement of the paddles to the edge of the gameboard.

More stretch goals to add:

-   allow the player to choose a difficulty, making the ball move faster, and possibly the computer player to be a little more accurate though it is pretty close and that second part would be a little more difficult to do without making it really hard for the player.
-   style the scoreboard to be more pleasing.
-   Convert game to React.

Keep an eye out for whats next, this was one of my first attempts at a game where I am playing with elements interacting and am going to put out a couple more different things in the next couple weeks!!!
